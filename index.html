          <p>S.M.A.R.T. is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of goals and objectives that are assumed to give better results, 
              for example in project management, employee-performance management and personal development. 
              The term was first proposed by George T. Doran in the November 1981 issue of Management Review.
              He suggested that goals should be SMART (specific, measurable, assignable, realistic and time-related). <br><br>

              Since then, other variations of the acronym have been used, a commonly used version includes the alternative words: attainable, relevant, and timely. 
              Additional letters have been added by some authors.
          </p>

          
          <h3>Usefulness</h3>

          </div>

          <p>
            Those who support the use of SMART objectives suggest they provide a clear road map for both the person setting the goal and the person evaluating their progress (e.g. employee and employer, or athlete and coach). 
            The person setting the goal is said to gain a clear understanding of what needs to be delivered and the person evaluating can then assess the outcome based on defined criteria. 
            SMART criteria are commonly associated with Peter Drucker's management by objectives concept.

          <h2>The steps to SMART</h2>
          <p>A SMART goal is used to help guide goal setting. SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. 
            Therefore, a SMART goal incorporates all of these criteria to help focus your efforts and increase the chances of achieving your goal. SMART-goals
            are defined as followed:</p>

            <img class="image_bg" style="height:100px;" src="images/definition_s.jpg"><br>
            <p><b>S</b>pecific: Well defined, clear, and unambiguous</p>
            <img class="image_bg" style="height:100px;" src="images/definition_m.jpg"><br>
            <p><b>M</b>easurable: With specific criteria that measure your progress toward the accomplishment of the goal</p>
            <img class="image_bg" style="height:100px;" src="images/definition_a.jpg"><br>
            <p><b>A</b>chievable: Attainable and not impossible to achieve</p>
            <img class="image_bg" style="height:100px;" src="images/definition_r.jpg"><br>
